While cycling in Belarus, I got lost and had to ask for directions. Yes, this was before GPS smartphone offline maps era so people had to ask directions. It&#8217;s also probably a single best excuse to approach a stranger in a far-far away land and also in a different tongue.  
I stopped and approached bypasser. &#8220;Privet. Gde Minsk?&#8221; my voice was quiet and slightly shivering. This was one of my first words in Russian. I never knew I could speak the language or, more importantly, be understood. Not really waiting for a feedback that a person understood I repeated sentence a bit louder &#8220;Gde Minsk?&#8221;. The local smiled and asked &#8220;Ty ponimaesh paruski?&#8221; (do you understand Russian?). I answered with most doubting voice ever &#8220;Daaa???&#8221;. My answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; sounded more like a question. However, the local being assured that I actually understand the language, he explained the route. I didn&#8217;t understand much. It could have been something like this &#8220;Now go straight for three blocks, turn left, after you see a shop, turn right, and go straight&#8221;. What I noticed during his monologue that he used &#8220;nalieva&#8221; and pointed fingers to a left, but later saying &#8220;naprava&#8221; he directed to the right. I tried to remember these words and assumed they&#8217;re correct.

Few more minutes later I got lost again and asked another local for directions. This time I was already aware what &#8220;naprava&#8221; and &#8220;naleva&#8221; means. He pointed to the same direction and explained the route. Once again, I understood only a few things. One more thing I noticed, that when he pointed an open palm straight with fingers, he said &#8220;priama&#8221;. I assumed it means straight.

Once again I was lost and asked a passerby for direction. Now my &#8220;gde Minsk&#8221; was loud and confident. This time no one doubted from my question that I actually understand the language.  
As I was cycling from city to city, I kept on asking directions mainly because I was lost but also a need to practise a language.  
I started to listen and catch more and more new words. One was &#8220;svetafor&#8221;. It kinda reminded my Lithuanian word &#8220;sviesaforas&#8221;, or English one &#8220;(traffic) semaphore&#8221;. I reckon word traffic light is frequently used while giving directions so I assumed that &#8220;svietafor&#8221; is traffic light.

Another pass-byer used the word &#8220;Most&#8221; as a verb in a sentence like &#8220;will be Most&#8221;. I&#8217;d no idea what it means but probably something that reassembles a lot in city planning architecture. A noun &#8220;most&#8221; reminds me of Lithuanian word &#8220;mostas&#8221; which is rarely used for a sharp turn. So I was going straight looking for a sharp turn to either side but got lost again and asked for directions. Weeks later I translated word &#8220;most&#8221; which apparently meant &#8220;bridge&#8221;. No wonder I got lost.

This was a thing with the Russian language, that I couldn&#8217;t use a translator because I don&#8217;t know Cyrillic and my spelling is roughly enough to match words in a dictionary. Well, Google is clever enough to convert my Latin spelling to Cyrillic and find meaning, but my dictionary apps at a time couldn&#8217;t do that. Therefore whenever I catch a phrase, I wouldn&#8217;t use a translator but try to come up with a meaning myself based on context. It&#8217;s highly beneficial technique to memorize a word too!

As soon as I got slightly lost, I asked again&#8230; and again&#8230;

I wanted to ask where is a grocery shop, but for this, I didn&#8217;t have to look up because one learns a lot just by looking around for signs. In socialist countries, an advertisement and marketing is not a thing. Ad banners are non-existing. Branding is unheard off (Visit Cuba or North Korea and we&#8217;ll see). Therefore a business would not put it&#8217;s own name and advertise but people still have to know what is inside so business owners put a big sign &#8220;Shop&#8221;, or &#8220;Restaurant&#8221;. This is facilitated vocabulary learning for me. For example, you drive and see a building with few parked cars around, and people leaving with full carrier bags. It also has a big sign on top &#8220;Produkty&#8221;. Later you notice a several stories high building with many identical windows. Maybe a friendly looking receptionist is visible as well. A sign on top of the building is &#8220;Gastinica&#8221;. One also might see a building in city centre many people sitting around tables watching big windows and eating delicious plates. The building with a sign &#8220;Restaurant&#8221; (or sometimes Zakusovka) on top. It has few tables with chairs outside, and people might be eating outside too. This gives great jump start for a traveller.

After a while asking &#8220;Where&#8217;s &#8230;&#8221; was no longer a challenge. I thought I&#8217;ll spice up my sentence and learn new words. I used my dictionary to search for &#8220;not expensive&#8221;. Next time I got hungry, I tested my sentence on locals &#8220;gde ni daroga zakusofva?&#8221;. I seemed to work as they gave me directions.

It seemed that the more I asked, the more confident I got on direction asking. After few weeks of wonder, I should&#8217;ve received Professional Bachelors in Russia language of direction asking.
