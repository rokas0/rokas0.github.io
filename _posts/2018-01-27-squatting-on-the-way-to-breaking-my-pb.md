Hey

This week is about strength training. My favourite is 5&#215;5 which works like magic. Until you hit a plateau and it becomes demotivating. You keep on failing to do complete 5&#215;5 every single week, your form gets worse and worse. Your squat is not as deep&#8230;

I was stuck at 150kg 5&#215;5 for months, I couldn&#8217;t do all sets of 5 repetitions. It drives me crazy.

The video below is from 2015 October, which is a highlight of my 5&#215;5 routine as learned at [80/20 Powerlifting and How to Add 110+ Pounds to Your Lifts](https://tim.blog/2008/12/18/pavel-8020-powerlifting-and-how-to-add-110-pounds-to-your-lifts/). I started at around 100kg 5&#215;5 and went all the way to 150kg but it got stuck there. Eating more, resting more, working out harder didn&#8217;t work.



But I still kept on going. Maybe one more week and it all be sorted. But it wasn&#8217;t.

Bloody 9 month later, I would squat same weight, although with a better form. It got stuck with no way up&#8230;



Another year passed, but squat is stuck at 5&#215;5 150kg. Two freaking years passed but my squat PB remained the same!



But was it? What should I do? Digging further on into books of the best strength teachers around the world&#8230;

> &#8220;I’m convinced that everything works. And, if you read my work, I think everything works for about six weeks&#8221; &#8211; Dan John&#8221;

Charles R. Poliquin or famously known as a Strength Sensei is recognized as one of the World’s most accomplished strength coaches. He wrote guidelines for muscle gain and defined several muscle laws including

> _&#8220;Muscle Law 4: Variety of loading parameters is critical to achieve mass gains.&#8221;_
> 
> _&#8220;Muscle Law 5: A program is only as good as the time it takes to adapt to it&#8221;_

The laws are so important in varying everything, the author even wrote final law

> _&#8220;Muscle Law 23: Varying the tempo of the exercise is critical in accelerating mass and strength gains&#8221;_

Pavel Tsatsouline suggests varying equipment and performance technique. Therefore I between heavy squatting in my barefoot and squatting shoes.

Moreover, not just training needs variation, but also food sources. If you been on chicken breasts for a while, consider a change. In cliche &#8220;if you been doing what you have ever been, you&#8217;ll get what you had&#8221;. One more general advice, have a plan in advance. Write in on a calendar and plan all our times off. Last but not least, times for a workout should be fairly consistent.  For example, if you workout in evenings and suddenly change to mornings, your results might drop by 1-4%. This is because your body temperature might change slightly if it&#8217;s adjusted for expected heavy loads. Therefore, stay with similar time of a day for workouts!

Given all lessons, I changed my 5&#215;5 program in something more challenging. I started following [Smolov program](https://stronglifts.com/how-to-add-100-pounds-to-your-squat-smolov/). My squatting schedule looked like this:

It includes squatting 4 times a week and varying sets/repetitions. Note: when you set your 1 repetition max (1 RM) it&#8217;s better to underestimation than overestimate.

A month in, I tried to break my PB:



Yahoooo!!!! I&#8217;ve broken my personal best and long plateau. Thanks to power of variation and Smolov squat program

Now a week of rest in a tropical Indian Ocean island. More about this in next week&#8217;s blog post!

Best wishes
